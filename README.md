1. [CONTROL] Next add the MAC address to the top of /bin/create_racks.sh

        # Each Rack in the Associative Array can take a string of MAC address separated by spaces.
        #
        # You need a rack defined for each type of resource class you intend to
        # create.
        #
        # Add MAC addresses to each defined rack for the nodes you intend to
        # provision as that resource type.

        # Be sure to associate the correct rack with this resource class.
